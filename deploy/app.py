similar those non pregnant adult patients developed COVID  pneumonia   These observations are also in line with what been learned about COVID  pneumonia in pregnancy in several hospitals in Wuhan  China  Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk assessment and infection control guidelines following exposure patients with suspected confirmed COVID   Adherence recommended infection prevention and control practices important part protecting healthcare professionals in clinical settings  First  although COVID  spread by airborne route  air disinfection cities and communities not known effective disease control and needs stopped  widespread practice spraying disinfectant and alcohol in sky  roads  vehicles  and personnel no value  moreover  large quantities alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful humans and should avoided     Second  in use personal protective equipment  we should try distinguish different risk factors  adopt different epidemic prevention measures  and reduce waste personal protective equipment  these resources are already in short supply  Although surgical masks are in widespread use by general population  there no evidence these masks prevent acquisition COVID   although they might slightly reduce spread from infected patient  High filtration masks such N masks and protective clothing  goggles and gowns  should used in hospitals where health care workers are in direct contact with infected patients  Third  practice blocking traffic and lockdown villages no value prevention and control COVID   Since outbreak COVID   countries suspended flights and from China  and prevented Chinese people from travelling their countries  these actions violate International Health Regulations  Similarly  in community prevention and control disease  measures taken by individual villages and communities seal off roads are no value  Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice  Fourth  public health education must based scientific evidence reduce anxiety and distress caused by misinformation  In particular  epidemiological findings need reported in timely and objective manner they can accurately assessed and interpreted  risk transmission with brief contact  less than  min face to face contact  infection onset after  days exposure known infected person  the estimated maximum incubation period  low and should not over exaggerated  Misinformation spreads panic among general population and not conducive implementation epidemic control measures  Fifth  made clear there are currently no known effective treatments COVID  and not recommend use antiviral drugs  antibiotics  glucocorticoids  traditional Chinese medicine  Despite this  there been reports use oseltamivir  lopinavir ritonavir  prednisone  antibiotics  and traditional Chinese medicine treatment patients with COVID   Care should taken not give patients drugs unknown efficacy  which might detrimental critically ill patients with COVID   clinical trials are urgently required in context  Likewise  development vaccine urgent public health priority  Abstract Purpose discuss different

complex situation patients in ICU  where viral spreading facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed respiratory tract  Therefore  clear definition infectiousness timing and intensity viral spreading mandatory alleviate burden health care system  Unfortunately  data available topic are scarce and composed only measurements viral shedding  without assessment infectivity  Kim et al    assessed viral load kinetics SARS CoV  in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in first two confirmed patients in Korea  They employed real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  rRT PCR  detect SARS CoV  and converted cycle threshold  CT  values rRT PCR into RNA copy number  detection limit rRT PCR   copies mL  Overall  viral load detection limit detected  and  days after symptoms onset and  and  days after first detection  respectively    note  patients received treatment with lopinavir ritonavir  Instead  Zou and colleagues analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from  symptomatic patients    They also employed rRT PCR and considered CT  detection limit  Higher viral loads observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptoms onset  Overall  only two patients prese ted positive samples  and only in nasal swab   days after symptoms onset  and with low viral load  In conclusion  larger amount data about duration viral spreading and infectivity in hospitalized patients  especially in ICU  badly needed better define quarantine period and avoid nosocomial transmission  Before their availability  canonical  days

COVID  life history and epidemiological parameters  Even under best case assumptions  we estimate screening will miss more than half infected people  Breaking factors leading screening successes and failures  we find most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable  because they not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they exposed  Our work underscores need measures limit
